Apartment Mapping

Used data from padmapper -> check out padmapper.com

Usage:
 - figure out your lat/lon boundaries
 - set lat/lon in query_padmapper.py and draw_heatmap.py
 - run query_padmapper.py 
   - creates apts.txt
 - run draw_heatmap.py
   - creates apts.png

You might do well to first set MAX_X and MAX_Y in draw_heatmap to something small (50) to
test that everything's working before you wait a long time for 1000x1000 or something.
